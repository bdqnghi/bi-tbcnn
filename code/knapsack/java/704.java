/**
 * Classical knapsack problem. We have a knapsack that
 * can carry a certain max. amount of load weight. And 
 * set of items with their weight and values.
 * Goal: maximize your amount of money that you can carry with
 * this knapsack.
 * i.e.:
 * items={(w:2,v:100),(w:4,v:200),(w:1,v:300),(w:3,v:250)}
 * capacity=7
 * knapsack(items,capacity)=600 (1,2,3. items)
